# AI Level 3 Program - Orange Digital Center Egypt & Digital HUB 🚀  


This program focuses on advanced AI technologies and practical implementations, covering: 

- **Computer Vision Tasks** 👀 

    - Object detection using yolov8
    - Butterfly & Moths Image Classification 100 species using pytorch

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🗣️   
    - Sentiment Analysis: Developing models that classify the sentiment of Arabic text.
     
- **Generative Models (GANs & VAEs)** 🎨  

    - Train a VAE to learn a latent space representation and generate images.

    - Train a DCGAN to generate high-quality fashion images.

    - Generated images are in color (RGB) instead of grayscale.

- **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** ⚙️ 
    - run an AI project (DL model ) with docker and run docker hub.
